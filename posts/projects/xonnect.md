- Implemented JSON parsing and request building logic to handle various API formats, parameters, and authentication patterns
- Integrated the application with cloud storage services such as Google Cloud Storage to store the fetched data automatically
- Deployed and ran the application on a Kubernetes cluster in the Google Kubernetes Engine
