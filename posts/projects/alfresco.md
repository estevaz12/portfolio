- Worked on a proof-of-concept using Alfresco to develop an extension that would communicate with a third-party API to get or post data
- Used the Alfresco SDK and Java to create the extension and configure the API integration
- Demonstrated the potential of the extension to connect Alfrescoâ€™s ECM system with an ads management application for publishing ad content
